# Astro_Sonification
This project analyzes high-resolution galaxy images and extracts pixel intensity (RGB) values using Python libraries such as numpy, csv and matplotlib.

Project Description
This repository contains scripts to:
- Load a dataset of galaxy images stored in an .npy file.
- Process the images to extract pixel data as RGB values.
- Display the images using matplotlib.
- Store the pixel data in a CSV file for further analysis.
- Converts the CSV file into sonified data using 3 different mapping techniques.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the .npy file of the galaxy image.
- `Extraction&Vizualisation_of_Image.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization.
- `output/`: Stores the extracted pixel data (CSV) and visual outputs.
- `image_sonification.ipynb`: Sonifies the CSV file using 3 mapping techniques.
- `Sonification_Output`: Contains the audio files generated.
