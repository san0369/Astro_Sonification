# Astro_Sonification
This project analyzes high-resolution galaxy images and extracts pixel intensity (RGB) values using Python libraries such as numpy, OpenCV, and matplotlib.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the .npy file of the galaxy image.
- `.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization.
- `output/`: Stores the extracted pixel data (CSV) and visual outputs.
